# üñ•Ô∏è MrSom3body/dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles repository! These configurations are tailored to me and
my system only (for now), so if you really want to copy my configs don't just
blindly use them but rather use them as a starting point.

## üíæ Credits & Resources

I‚Äôve drawn inspiration from these fantastic projects, people and sources:

- [fufexan/dotfiles](https://github.com/fufexan/dotfiles) (shamelessly copied
  most of my config from here)
- [librephoenix/nixos-config](https://github.com/librephoenix/nixos-config)
- [NixOS & Flakes Book](https://nixos-and-flakes.thiscute.world/)
- [Vimjoyer](https://www.youtube.com/@vimjoyer)
- and many many more...

Feel free to explore, adapt, and contribute!
