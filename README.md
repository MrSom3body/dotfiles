Welcome to my dotfiles repository! These configurations are tailored to me and
my system only (for now), so if you really want to copy my configs don't just
blindly use them but rather use them as a starting point.

## 💾 Credits & Resources

I’ve drawn inspiration from these fantastic projects:

- [fufexan/dotfiles](https://github.com/fufexan/dotfiles)
- [librephoenix/nixos-config](https://github.com/librephoenix/nixos-config)
- and many more

Feel free to explore, adapt, and contribute!
