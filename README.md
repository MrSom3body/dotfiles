# üñ•Ô∏è MrSom3body/dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles repository! These configurations are tailored to me and
my system only (for now), so if you really want to copy my configs don't just
blindly use them but rather use them as a starting point.

## üß™ Try It

You can also try my configuration in a VM extremely easy if you're running NixOS
with this simple command:

```bash
nixos-rebuild build-vm --flake github:MrSom3body/dotfiles#nixos
```

If you want to use my configuration you'll need a few things:

1. a hardware configuration file (will be created on initial installation under
   `/etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix`)
2. a directory under `./hosts` (look at `./hosts/blackbox` for an example)

Move the `hardware-configuration.nix` file to your own host directory. After
that edit the `default.nix` file and import your hardware configuration and
everything else you want.

Chances are you don't have the same name, so just change it in `./settings.nix`.

Finally, rebuild the configuration, and you're done :)

## üì¶ Packages

My repository also provides some packages that may be useful for you:
